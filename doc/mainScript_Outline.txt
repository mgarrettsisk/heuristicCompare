Comparison of Heuristic Search performance using a Maze Solver Agent




DFS (Baseline)
Random Least-Travelled Heuristic
Instantaneous Euclidean Distance Heuristic
Continuous Euclidean Distance Heuristic


4 Examples, 4 trials, with 4 results able to be tabulated.

Performance Metric:

Amount of cells in found path, vs amount of cells traversed
	This is the competitive ratio

In order to run the experiment:

Need to generate 100 mazes, for each maze, generate 50 sets of start/finish pairs
	For each of these configurations, run the following solvers:
		DFS (baseline)
		Random-Walk Heuristic
		Euclidean Distance
		Euclidean distance with Look Ahead
	In each of the above, the following information must be tabulated:
		For each set of start/finish pairs:
			Solution Path Length (number of cells)
			Total number of cells traversed by agents

		
Maze Number, Start/Finish Number, Solution Path Length, DFS, Random-Walk, Euclidean, Euclidean Look Ahead
