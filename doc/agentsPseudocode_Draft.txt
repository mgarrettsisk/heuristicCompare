Heuristic with Look Ahead:

At the current cell
	1) Determine Possible Moves
	2) Of the possible moves, deploy an agent that will traverse 5 cells in each direction
		2.1) Up Move mini agent
			2.1.1) Determine Possible Moves
			2.1.2) Move to lowest valued cell (not currentCell)
			2.1.3) If a dead-end, reverse and try another direction
			2.1.4) If goal cell reached, return 0
			2.1.5) Once 5 cells have been traversed, return distance
		2.2-2.4) Down, Left, Right mini agents
			Repeat the above, but starting with respective cell
	3) Once the mini-agent with the lowest value reports back, move to that cell and repeat process
	4) Continue this until the end state is reached


DFS

	1) Determine possible moves
	2) Move to next squares in the following order: up, right, down, left
		2.0) Mark Cell as Visited
		2.1) When a dead-end is reached, move backwards until another move is possible, cells w/ 0 visits take precedence over previously visited cells
		2.2) Take the next possible move
		2.3) Repeat
	3) Repeat the above until a goal state is reached.


Random Walk
	1) Determine possible moves
	2) Pick a move at random to move to, move to that one
	3) Repeat until goal state is found
